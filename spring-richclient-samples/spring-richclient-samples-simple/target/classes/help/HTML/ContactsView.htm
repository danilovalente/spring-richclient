<h1>Contacts View</h1>
<p>The Contacts view, shown below,&nbsp;presents the 
toolbar and the summary table of all the contacts within the data store.</p>
<p><IMG height=380 hspace=0 src="../Images/contactView.jpg" 
width=800 border=0></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The toolbar contains actions that are also present in the File menu.&nbsp; 
The platform supports placing an action into multiple containers.&nbsp; 
Enabling/disabling a command will properly affect the state of all renderings (faces)&nbsp;of 
the action within the GUI.</p>
<p>The summary table is constructed using components in the platform that 
leverage the power of the Glazed Lists project.&nbsp; Glazed lists provides for 
easy creation of filtered and sorted lists and the creation of a table model from 
such a compound list.&nbsp; Further the table model supports multi-column 
sorting on the table.&nbsp; As shown above the sort indicator is on the "Last 
Name" column.&nbsp; By clicking on any of the other headers, you will add a 
secondary sort on that column.&nbsp; Clicking on a third column will add a 
tertiary sort, and so on.&nbsp; To reset the sort to a single primary column, 
simply double click on one of the column headers.</p>
<p>The "Name/Address filter" text entry field offers <em>as you type</em> 
filtering of the contents displayed in the table.&nbsp; Any text entered in the 
field will be matched against each contact's&nbsp;<font 
face="Times New Roman">lastName</font> and address1 fields.&nbsp; Any records 
that match are displayed, records that don't match are filtered from the 
view.</p>
<P>In order to edit the properties of a contact, select a row in the table and 
then click the properties toolbar button (or choose properties from the File 
menu, or from the context menu, or just double click the row).&nbsp; The 
properties dialog will be displayed, as shown below.</P>
<P><IMG height=486 hspace=0 src="../Images/contactProperties.jpg" width=590 
border=0></P>
<P>Here, any properties of the Contact entry can be edited.&nbsp; Note in the 
image above that one of the property constraints have been violated and the Last 
Name field is displayed with a small red "x" icon and a message in the title 
pane indicates that the field is required.&nbsp; Also, note that while the 
validation error is present, the "Ok" button is automatically disabled.&nbsp; 
Support for property constraints (even inter-property constraints) are an 
important feature of the Spring Rich platform.</P>
