/**
 * Sub-interface implemented by form models that can be part of a form model
 * hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * In a HierarchicalFormModel:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the enabled state of the parent is inherited by the children. So if the
 * parent is disabled then the child is also disabled; however if the child is
 * disabled the parent might not be disabled.
 * <li>the dirty state of the chidren is inherited by the parent. So if one or
 * more of the children are dirty then the parent is also dirty. However if the
 * parent is dirty the children my not be.
 * <li>the readOnly state of the parent is inherited by the children. If the
 * parent is readOnly, all children are readOnly as well. However a child may be
 * readOnly while the parent is not.
 * </ul>
