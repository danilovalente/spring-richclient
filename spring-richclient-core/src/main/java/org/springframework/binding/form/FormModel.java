/**
 * <p>
 * A formModel groups valueModels and actions that are related to the same
 * backing object. It will manage the creation/handling of the valueModels,
 * their associated metadata and an overal state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The formModel can be in one of three 'user' states:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Disabled:</em> all user interaction should be ignored.</li>
 * <li><em>Enabled and readOnly:</em> user may interact, but not edit.</li>
 * <li><em>Enabled and editable:</em> user may interact and edit where
 * needed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * These states are counterparts of the enabled/editable state of a
 * component/textcomponent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The formModel also tracks its inner states:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Dirty:</em> one of its valueModels has a changed value.</li>
 * <li><em>Committable:</em> all valueModels are in an 'error-free' state.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </>
