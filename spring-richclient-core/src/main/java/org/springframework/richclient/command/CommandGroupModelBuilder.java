 * trees) is done through callbacks to specific buildXXXModel methods. (which

 * 
 * Actual use assumes one sublasses and implements those required abstract

 * subclasses the opportunity to build up his matching model matching the
 * command-group nesting by calling the various buildXXXModel methods.
