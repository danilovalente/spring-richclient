/**
 * A registry for command objects. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * The commands to be placed in the registry must have non-null identifiers available via their 
 * {@link AbstractCommand#getId()} method, and this id is expected to be unique amongst all the 
 * commands in the application. Generally speaking, this uniqueness will not be enforced by the 
 * framework but will instead allow commands to be overwritten by others with the same id.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations may allow for the creation of hierarchical registries whereby a registry may have
 * a parent registry. In this case, if a registry does not contain a requested command it will
 * delegate to its parent to find the command. Commands in a child registry will override commands
 * with the same ID in any ancestor registries.
