 * this list can be instances of the actual command or they can be strings that
 * represent the identifier of the command. Some strings have special meaning:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@value #GLUE_MEMBER_CODE}: Represents a 'glue' component between
 * command group members.</li>
 * <li>{@value #SEPARATOR_MEMBER_CODE}: Represents a separator between command
 * group members.</li>
 * </ul>
