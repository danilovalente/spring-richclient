/**
 * A view is a panel-like component displayed within an area on the page associated with an application window. There
 * can be multiple views per page; a single view can only be displayed once on a single page.
 * 
 * View instances encapsulate the creation of and access to the visual presentation of the underlying control. A view's
 * descriptor -- which is effectively a singleton -- can be asked to instantiate new instances of a single view for
 * display within an application with multiple windows. In other words, a single view instance is never shared between
 * windows.
