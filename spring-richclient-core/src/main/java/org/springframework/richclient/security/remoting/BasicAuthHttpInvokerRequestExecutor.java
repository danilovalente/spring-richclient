/**
 * Adds BASIC authentication support to <code>SimpleHttpInvokerRequestExecutor</code>.
 * This class assumes that a single authentication credential will be used for the whole
 * application (as is typical with a rich client). So, regardless of the thread involved,
 * it will use the Authentication object obtained from the last authentication token
 * received.
 * <p>
 * In comparison, see
 * {@link org.springframework.security.context.httpinvoker.AuthenticationSimpleHttpInvokerRequestExecutor}
 * for a class that manages the Authentication per-thread. If you need to have threads
 * with different authentication credentials, then you should use the Spring Security class instead.
 * <p>
 * Typically, instances of this class will be automatically created by using
 * {@link BasicAuthHttpInvokerProxyFactoryBean}, which will take care of keeping this
 * instance updated with the latest authentication token.  In case you want to use this
 * executor with a different invoker factory, this class implements
 * {@link AuthenticationAware} so that it will automatically receive notification of
 * changes in the authentication token.
 * <p>
 * Note that this configuration could lead to instances of this class receiving two
 * notifications of an authentication token change.  However, that would only happen
 * if both the {@link BasicAuthHttpInvokerProxyFactoryBean} is used and this class
 * is created as a bean in the application context.  This seemed unlikely enough
 * that I erred on the side of "ease of use".  Also, the current implementation
 * does nothing more than store a reference to the new token, so receiving two
 * notifications isn't a problem.
