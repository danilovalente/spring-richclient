 * A Spring managed bean implementing this interface will be automatically notified of any

 * have {@link #setAuthenticationToken(Authentication)} called when it is created and
 * subsequently whenever the user's authentication token changes.

 * In order for this notification to take place, a singleton, non-lazy instance of
