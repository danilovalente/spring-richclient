 * application security lifecycle. See {@link ClientSecurityEvent} and its subclasses.
 * <p>
 * The Security Manager is available as an application service via
 * {@link org.springframework.richclient.application.ApplicationServices#getSecurityManager}.
 * <p>
 * See {@link SecurityAwareConfigurer} for more details on how to configure components for
 * automatic notification of security events.
