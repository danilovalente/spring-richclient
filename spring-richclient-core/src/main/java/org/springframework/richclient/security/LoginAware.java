/**
 * A Spring managed bean implementing this interface will be automatically notified of any
 * user login or logout activities. Any bean implementing this interface will have
 * {@link #userLogin(Authentication)} or {@link #userLogout(Authentication)}, called when
 * the user performs a login or logout activity, respectively.
 * <p>
 * In order for this notification to take place, a singleton, non-lazy instance of
 * {@link SecurityAwareConfigurer} must be defined in the Spring ApplicationContext. See
 * {@link SecurityAwareConfigurer} for configuration details.

 * If a class needs to track the actual security event lifecycle, then it should implement
 * {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener} and watch for instances of
 * {@link org.springframework.richclient.security.ClientSecurityEvent} events.
