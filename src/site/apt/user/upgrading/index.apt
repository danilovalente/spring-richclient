Upgrading

    Backwards compability is sometimes broken to create a better overall framework design.

    To ease the upgrading path of our users, the most user-impacting upgrades are noted here.
    By following these recipes it should be fairly straight-forward to upgrade to the latest version.
    If you had to do extra things during an upgrade, please notify us, so we can add it here.

    Use the left side menu.
