Fake certificate for spring-richclient demo
===========================================

Normally, private keys (in a keystore) aren't shared for security reasons,
but to allow all spring-richclient developers to create the website with webstart demo's etc,
the private key is shared in Subversion. This makes our certificate unsecure, hence the name "fake".

The keystore contains one certificate with complementairy private key.
- Keystore password: spring-richclient

Certificate "Fake certificate for spring-richclient demo"
- Ceritificate alias: spring-richclient
- Self-signed
