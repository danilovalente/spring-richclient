  <section id="commands:abtraction-why">
    <title>Why the abstraction</title>
    <para>
      Creating an abstraction over an action-based operation is quite logical when you think about it. You have
      behavior, which can be visually represented in different ways in Swing: a menu, a button or even just a clickable
      label.
    </para>
    <para>Managing this behavior can be cumbersome if you need to maintain it, especially when certain behavior is to be
      represented many times and in different ways. By taking a step back and abstraction the way how behavior gets
      decoupled from the visual representation, reusing that behavior is a lot easier to achieve.
    </para>

  <section id="commands:simple-create">
    <title>How to create a simple command</title>
    <para>
      Let’s make a simple command that shows a messagebox when executed:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="java:nogutter"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/java/sample1.java" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>Creating a new command can be done by extending ActionCommand. This class mandates that you implement the
      doExecuteCommand method, which represents the behavior of the command.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:configure-command">
    <title>Configure a programmatically created command</title>
    <para>
      Programmatically created commands need to be configured, since Spring Rich Client heavily relies on the Spring
      container to do the configuring. So when you create command objects in code, you’ll have to do the configuring
      yourself.
    </para>
    <para>This can be done by calling the command configurer through the service locator in Spring Rich Client:</para>
    <programlisting language="java:nogutter"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/java/sample2.java" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      After the command has been configured, it can be used to create components.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:change-visual">
    <title>Transforming the command to a visual component</title>
    <para>
      After a command is configured, it can be used to create visual components. These can be:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Menu items
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Buttons
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Creating a visual component from a command is easy. Every command has methods to create visual components,
      with the command’s behavior coupled to it.
    </para>
    <para>For buttons this is</para>
    <programlisting language="java:nogutter"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/java/sample3.java" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>For menu items this is</para>
    <programlisting language="java:nogutter"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/java/sample4.java" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      Both methods have various parameter configurations, for more information on which to use in your scenario, refer
      to the JavaDoc documentation.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:i18n">
    <title>Commands i18n and images</title>
    <para>
      A button needs a text label, perhaps an icon. We’ll now show you how you can put messages on your commands and
      link icons to them.
    </para>
    <para>When configuring a command, Spring Rich Client sets a “face descriptor” on the command. This face descriptor
      manages how the command looks like. A face descriptor is put on the command by utilizing the id of the command. In
      a Spring configured command, this is the id of the Spring bean. Programmatically created commands need to set
      their command ids themselves. If you don’t set the command’s id, Spring Rich Client will fallback to the
      camel-cased class name of the command class. In our example, this will be the case, as we haven’t set the id.
    </para>
    <para>The label of the command, and other text related messages for that matter, is found in the message source
      configured for the Spring Rich Client application. To find the label of a command, Spring Rich Client searches
      for:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="text"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/text/sample1.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>Similarly, you can put a caption on a command. In the case of a JButton, this will translate itself into a
      tooltip message:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="text"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/text/sample2.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>Commands can also have icons coupled to them. Spring Rich Client will look for the message keys and images in
      the image source configured for the application. To find the icon for a command, Spring Rich client will search
      for:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="text"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/text/sample3.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:grouping">
    <title>Grouping commands</title>
    <para>
      Commands can also be groups. Command groups in Spring Rich Clients are composite commands. They can be used to
      create menus, button stacks and other aggregate components.
    </para>
    <para>
      Command groups behave similarly to commands (command groups are subclasses of commands), so the configuration
      works in the same way. They can also be configured in the Spring context, as well as programmatically. However, in
      the latter case, the same rules as commands apply.
    </para>
    <para>
      Adding commands to a command group is easy, just call the add method. Creating a visual component of a command
      group works the same way as commands. Spring Rich Client provides functionality for:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Menus
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Vertical button stacks
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Horizontal button bars
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Toolbars
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Popup menus
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      See the JavaDoc documentation for more information on the usage of these creation methods. With some effort, you
      can even make trees, taskpanes or outlook-bar style grouping.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:building-group">
    <title>Building a command group in a Spring context</title>
    <para>
        Given our hands-dirty example, we’ll look at a command group configured there:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/xml/sample1.xml" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      As you can see, creating a command group is straightforward. You create a command group through a factory bean and
      set the members.
    </para>
    <para>
      You may have noticed the “separator” value in the members. Spring Rich Client has facilitated adding separators to
      menus and toolbars by adding this as a shortcut.
    </para>
    <para>
      Other shortcuts that can be used as values are:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>glue</literal> : Add a glue between commands
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>command:xyz</literal> : Add a command with id xyz to the group. You could use this instead of bean
          references
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>group:abc</literal> : Add a command group with id abc to the group. You could use this instead of bean
          references
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Not only commands or shortcuts can be added. Also just ordinary JComponent can be added to command groups. This
      way you can easily add a textfield to a toolbar.
    </para>
    <para>
      These command groups can then be referenced for example in the lifecycle advisor to be used as the application’s
      menu bar, tool bar or other navigation you might have implemented.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:get-command">
    <title>Getting a Spring configured command in code</title>
    <para>
      Getting a command that you have configured in a Spring context can be done by searching for it based on its id:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="java:nogutter"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/java/sample5.java" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      This will return the command if it can find a command with that id, or null otherwise. You don’t need to configure
      this command after you’ve found it, Spring Rich Client has already handled this for you.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:global-commands">
    <title>Defining global commands</title>
    <para>
       Global commands are commands of which the behavior can change depending on the context. A certain view can set the behavior of a command different than that of another view. An example of this can for example be the “New” action. Depending on the context, other actions need to occur. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Spring Rich Client handles these occurrences by using shared commands. Adding a shared command is done by adding the ids to the command manager, like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/xml/sample2.xml" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      These commands can also be added in a command group:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/xml/sample3.xml" parse="text"/></programlisting>
  </section>

  <section id="commands:shortcuts">
    <title>Addding shortcuts to commands</title>
    <para>
       Shortcuts are omnipotent nowadays. As soon as a users learns a shortcut for a particular action, he’ll use it more and more. You’ll be happy to hear in that case Spring Rich Client supports shortcut configuration out of the box. And with minimal effort.
    </para>
    <para>
      To add a shortcut for a command in Spring Rich Client, you just need to change the label for the command
    </para>
    <para>
      A command configured like this
    </para>
    <programlisting language="text"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/text/sample4.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      can be enriched with a shortcut, for example Ctrl + N, by changing the message to
    </para>
    <programlisting language="text"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/text/sample5.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      In a menu, for example, you’ll also see the shortcut when adding it to a command.
    </para>
    <para>
      Shortcuts that can be used are compliant to the Keystroke class in standard Java, which amount to      
    </para>
    <programlisting language="text"><xi:include href="../codesamples/commands/text/sample6.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
    <para>
      For example, you can use F1, ctrl A, ctrl alt X, alt INSERT, … Currently, only Windows shortcuts are supported, support for Mac commands is underway and currently being developed.
    </para>
